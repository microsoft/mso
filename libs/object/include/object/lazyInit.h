namespace Mso { namespace Object {

// A class that lazily initializes its data member in a thread-safe fashion. If stored in a global object, this class
// can be used to provide Singleton functionality. However, before using this class in this way, please research whether
// a Singleton is required for your scenarios as there are often preferable alternatives.
//
// The data member type must derive from either Mso::IRefCounted or IUnknown.
//
// The object in the class should be constructed by calling Create(), specifying any constructor parameters as required.
// This method will return a pointer to the underlying object. Note that multiple simultaneous calls to Create() may
// result in multiple objects being created. However, all objects except for one will be discarded. This means that your
// constructor should not have any permanent side effects resulting from calling Create() multiple times.
//
// The pointer can also be retrieved by calling Get(). This will return nullptr if the underlying object has not yet
// been created.
//
// The underlying object can be released by calling Release(). Subsequent calls to Get() will return the nullptr, but
// a new instance of the object can be created by again calling Create(). Release() will be called automatically by the
// destructor if it is not manually called beforehand.
//
// Note that the pointer returned by these methods should not be deleted or copied into some mechanism for managing
// memory. All necessary memory management takes place within the LazyInit class.
