CancellationTokenSource and CancellationToken provide support for cancellation patterns used for futures.

CancellationTokenSource is an owner of the cancellation token state.
It has methods Cancel() and Abandon() which set the cancellation state to true and false.
When all instances of CancellationTokenSource pointing to the same state are destroyed, then its ref count goes to zero
and the state's destructor calls Abandon().
The GetToken() method returns the CancellationToken associated with the CancellationTokenSource instance.

CancellationToken is a class to observe the cancellation token state.
It has IsCanceled, WhenChanged, and WhenCancelled methods to either check the state or to subscribe to its changes.

Typical usage scenario is when the code that may originate the cancellation creates an instance of
CancellationTokenSource.

  CancellationTokenSource tokenSource;

Then to all observers we pass the CancellationToken instance to observe cancellation:

  future.Then(Mso::Async::ConcurrentQueue(), [token = tokenSource.GetToken()](std::vector<int>& data) noexcept
  {
    if (!token.IsCancelled())
    {
      ...
    }
  });

Alternatively, developers can subscribe to the cancellation token state changes:

CancellationToken token = tokenSource.GetToken();
token.WhenCancelled([]() { ... });                       // called only when Cancel() is called
token.WhenChanged().Then([](bool isCancelled) { ... });  // called only when Cancel() or Abandon() are called

The original code can either call Cancel() method to set cancellation state to true:

  tokenSource.Cancel();

Or do nothing and then the state will be set to false when CancellationTokenSource state ref count goes to zero.
To enforce setting cancellation state to false without waiting for the ref counting becoming zero, developers can call
Abandon() method:

  tokenSource.Abandon();

When Cancel() or Abandon() methods are called, any code that subscribed to observe changes in state by using WhenChanged
or WhenCancelled methods is released after execution. So, calling Abandon() may help to release resources earlier if
needed.

Note that only ref count affected by CancellationTokenSource instances defines when the state is released and Abandon()
method is called. The CancellationToken instances can be considered as weak pointers and do not affect when the
Abandon() method is called.

Internally the cancellation token state has two IFuture instances.
One is an IFuture instance pointed by CancellationTokenSource instances.
Another is an observer IFuture instance pointed by CancellationToken instances.
The first IFuture instance owns the second one as a continuation. Since only the first IFuture instance guarantees the
lifetime of the pair, the CancellationTokenSource can be considered as a "strong" pointer, and CancellationToken as a
"weak" pointer.
