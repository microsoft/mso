//! Signal the ManualResetEvent by calling its Set method. A ManualResetEvent object remains signaled until
//! its Reset method is called. Any number of waiting threads, or threads that wait on the event after it has
//! been signaled, can be released while the object's state is signaled. Until it is reset, by calling its
//! Reset method, threads that wait on the event handle proceed immediately without blocking.
//!
//! A manual reset event acts like the gate of a corral. When the event is not signaled, threads that wait on
//! it block, like horses in a corral. When the event is signaled, by calling its Set method, all waiting
//! threads are free to proceed. The event remains signaled until its Reset method is called. This makes the
//! manual reset event an ideal way to hold up threads that need to wait until one thread finishes a task.
//!
//! Like horses leaving a corral, it takes time for the released threads to be scheduled by the operating
//! system and to resume execution. If the Reset method is called before all the threads have resumed
//! execution, the remaining threads once again block. Which threads resume and which threads block depends
//! on random factors like the load on the system, the number of threads waiting for the scheduler, and
//! so on. This is not a problem if the thread that signals the event ends task after signaling, which is the
//! most common usage pattern. If you want the thread that signaled the event to begin a new task after all
//! the waiting threads have resumed, you must block it until all the waiting threads have resumed.
//! Otherwise, you have a race condition, and the behavior of your code is unpredictable.

//! Signal the event by calling its Set method. An AutoResetEvent object is automatically reset to
//! non-signaled by the system after a single waiting thread has been released. If no threads are waiting,
//! the event object's state remains signaled.
//!
//! Automatic reset events are usually used to provide exclusive access to a resource for a single thread at
//! a time. A thread requests the resource by calling the Wait method. If no other thread is holding the wait
//! handle, the method returns true and the calling thread has control of the resource.
//!
//! (!)Important
//! As with all synchronization mechanisms, you must ensure that all code paths wait on the appropriate wait
//! handle before accessing a protected resource. Thread synchronization is cooperative.
//!
//! If an automatic reset event is signaled when no threads are waiting, it remains signaled until a thread
//! attempts to wait on it. The event releases the thread and immediately resets, blocking subsequent threads.
