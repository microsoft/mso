  If a library has no direct entry points, it may be necessary to force

  1) Preferably - link the library as a LOB instead.

  2) Use MSO_DEFINE_SYMBOL to define a symbol in the source file that needs to
  be included. Then, add the corresponding MSO_LINK_SYMBOL macro to one of the
  source files that gets compiled directly into your binary (as an *.obj file)
